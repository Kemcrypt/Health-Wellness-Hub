      <h1 class="align">Embrace Your Self Defence</h1>
      <p>Self-defense is the proactive practice of protecting oneself from physical harm by employing a combination of
        awareness, avoidance, and preparedness. This involves staying vigilant, making wise choices to avoid potential
        threats, and learning and practicing physical techniques for responding effectively to imminent danger. Beyond
        physical skills, self-defense encompasses verbal de-escalation, assertiveness, and conflict resolution to
        diffuse situations without resorting to violence. Personal safety also involves making smart lifestyle choices.
        Overall, self-defense is a holistic approach to ensuring individual well-being, promoting confidence, and
        contributing to a safer community.</p>
