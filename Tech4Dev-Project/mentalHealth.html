    <h1>What is Mental Health</h1>
    <p>Mental health refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being—the state of one's mind and how it functions, including emotional well-being, cognitive function, and the ability to manage stress and relate to others. It is a crucial aspect of overall health, as mental health influences how people think, feel, and act.</p>

  <h1>Key components of mental health include:</h1>
  <p><strong>Emotional Well-being:</strong> This involves understanding and managing emotions, as well as being able to cope with life's challenges.</p>
  <p><strong>Cognitive Function:</strong> Mental health includes cognitive abilities such as thinking, reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.</p>
  <p><strong>Social Well-being:</strong> This relates to one's ability to build and maintain healthy relationships, communicate effectively, and engage in a supportive social environment.</p>
  <p><strong>Resilience:</strong> Mental health is not just the absence of mental disorders but also the presence of resilience—the ability to bounce back from adversity and cope with life's ups and downs.</p>
